Hi, I’m @cilippofilia!

- I really enjoy coding and programming in different languages.
- My first love was Swift and SwiftUI, then I learn a bit of Front-end Development (HTML/CSS + JavaScript)
- I’m currently following Codecademy Paths: iOS Developer & Full Stack Developer and I have just started a Software Engineering bootcamp at HyperionDev.
