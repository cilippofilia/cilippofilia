Hi, I’m @cilippofilia!

- I’m interested in SwiftUI, Blockchain, Web 3.0 and Cryptocurrencies.
- I’m currently catching up with SwiftUI, again.
- Being a professional iOS developer is my final goal.
- This GitHub profile will tell the story of my journey of becoming an iOS Dev from scratch.

You can reach out to me on:
  Twitter   -> @cilippofilia
