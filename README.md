Hello! 

I'm @cilippofilia 👨‍💻, a passionate programmer with a love for coding in various languages. My journey started with Swift and SwiftUI, but I soon found myself dabbling in the world of full stack development.

I'm currently on an exciting learning journey, studying:
- 🐍 Python
- 🧱 HTML/CSS
- 🎨 Django
- 🐬 mySQL

I'm following Codecademy Paths for both iOS and Full Stack Development, and I've also embarked on an intensive Software Engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev.

If you're looking for a talented freelance developer, you can check out my work on Fiverr, where I offer my skills and expertise to bring your projects to life.

And if you want to connect with me, feel free to reach out on Twitter or Instagram, where I'm always happy to chat about all things tech and programming. 

So what are you waiting for? Let's connect and create something amazing together! 🤝
